1. How would you describe the concept of "state"?
R: State is a value managed within the component, in order
to attend some logic. Or a value a component can maintain
 between render cycles.


2. When would you want to use props instead of state?
R: In situations which you want to pass a value to a component
as a reference and you don't want that reference to be changed
within the component. Exemple when you want to pass data to get
displayed on the screen.

3. When would you want to use state instead of props?
R: In situations which you want a value to be managed within the component.
(And "remember" those values even when React re-renders the component).

4. What does "immutable" mean? Are props immutable? Is state immutable?
R: Immutable means something that can't be changed, props are immutable
while state is not immutable.


//analogy: variable name = props and timeOfDay = state, greeting = component
const date = new Date();
const hours = date.getHours();
let timeOfDay

function greeting(name){
if(4<=hours<12){
    timeOfDay = "morning"
}else if(12<=hours<17){
    timeOfDay = "afternoon"
}else if(17<=hours<20){
    timeOfDay = "evening"
}else{
    timeOfDay = "night"
}

return `Good ${timeOfDay}, ${name}!`
}

console.log(greeting("Bob"))
